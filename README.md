:memo: **Short summary:**
Spinal cord injury (SCI) research has gathered extensive data, but analysis methods rely on complete data, posing challenges when dealing with missingness. Researchers commonly exclude patients with missing data or use imputation methods. This study aimed to understand how handling missing data in SCI registries affects reported results and provide guidelines for future research. Using Sygen clinical trial data, we analyzed the impact of missing data variables, patterns, and imputation strategies.
